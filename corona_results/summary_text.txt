Based on the integrated implementation of how many people are able (in this run based on the 
 age: 12) and willing to get the vaccination (currently implemented: 0.9), 
 there is a relative vaccination potential of 0.80145 for the German population. 
 Based on this percentage and the assumed vaccine deliveries the model generates the following 
 forecast: 
 
 At the 08.08.21 everyone who is able and willing will have his or her 1st vaccination. 
 At the 19.09.21 everyone who is able and willing will have his/her full vaccination. 
 At the 03.10.21 the maximum relative immunity is reached with 0.726. 
 Simultanously at the 03.10.21 a R-value of 3.653 is reduced to 1.
